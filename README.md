# Root Insurance Project -- Team Doodee
This is a Erdos data science Bootcamp project. We explore the dataset from insurance customers in a car insurance website. We'll try to evaluate different tyeps of customers and give different bid prices for different customers so as to show the insurance advertisement at a rank.

## The goals of the project

- Understand the dataset: we have dataset with 10,000 "impressions" of ads, where the relation between customers and the insurance commercials hides.
- The marketing manager of the insurance company wants to understand how to bid differently for different customers so as to improve the ads performance.
- Bidding strategy: "optimize the cost per customer while having 4% customer rate over all ads shown". Bidding higher will make the ad to be shown higher in the ranking, but we do not know how the bidding change the ranking.
- Find some interesting relations for the website manager.

### A glance of the dataset

We'll first explore how the dataset looks like and how the customers are featured.
